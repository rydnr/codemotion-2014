** Modularization
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_BACKGROUND: maven-graph-bg.png
:END:

*** Convention 						      :B_block:

- All logic is isolated in its own module.
- No multi-module projects, unless for WARs.
- All modules inherit from a common, logic-less module: the parent POM.

** Parent POM
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_BACKGROUND: maven-graph-bg.png
:END:

*** Our Parent POM is useful as long as... 			    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- Declares all dependencies in one place.
- Ensures all modules use the same versions of the dependencies.
- Defines common configurations for maven plugins.
- Simplifies child poms.
- Uses Maven properties to specify the versions of in-house modules.


** Versioning
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_BACKGROUND: maven-versioning-bg.png
:END:

*** Versions are unique and time-ordered 		      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

- All in-house modules, share the same version: \texttt{latest-SNAPSHOT}.
- All local environments get always up-to-date code.
- Versions are resolved when generating releases.

*** Generates unique version numbers
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- Helper job to automate the tagging and packaging process.
- Checks out parent-pom code.
- Parameterized job with a single parameter: the name of the module triggering the release.
- Should have higher priority to avoid slot starvation and deadlocks in Jenkins.
- Expects parent-pom to contain two properties: version.major and version.minor.

:END:

*** One \textbf{job} to rule them all
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- When a commit is pushed to the remote repository, Jenkins launches the associated job.
- The job is a Maven job, which runs \texttt{mvn deploy}.
- If it succeeds, calls \texttt{get-new-version} with its own name as parameter.

** \textit{get-new-version} job (3)
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_BACKGROUND: jenkins-get-new-version-3-bg.png
:END:

*** maven-versions-plugin magic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- Parses the parent pom and defines a new version using a convention: $V = major.minor.BUILD\_NUMBER$ (provided by Jenkins).
- Using \textbf{maven-versions-plugin}:
  * Points itself to new version $V$.
  * Uses the latest released versions for all modules.
  * Ensures the version for the triggering module becomes $V$.
- Builds a release the Maven way, with \textbf{maven-release-plugin}.
- Publishes the new pom, with references to the latest released versions of each module.

:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_BACKGROUND: jenkins-get-new-version-4-bg.png
:END:

*** Finally
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- The trigger module, using \textbf{maven-versions-plugin} again, updates its own pom to point to the newly released parent pom.
- Accordingly, uses \textbf{maven-release-plugin} to build all required artifacts and tag the new version: $V$.
- For each commit, (at least) two artifacts are generated: parent-pom-$V$ and module-$V$.

*** Maven Embedded is too embedded 				    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- Maven jobs in Jenkins run Maven Embedded engine.
- Maven annotates parent jobs as dependencies in the dependency graph.
- For \textit{get-new-version} to work, it cannot be a Maven job: It has to call Maven from the command line.
- Otherwise, it triggers an infinite loop of downstream jobs.

    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:

``The Docker Engine container comprises just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers. Thus, it enjoys the resource isolation and allocation benefits of VMs but is much more portable and efficient.''

*** Packaging applications
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block

- \textbf{Image}: Packaged application and dependencies. Ready to launch.
- \textbf{Container}: An isolated (process, memory, network, etc.) environment, running an \textit{image}.
- \textbf{Volume}: A folder within a container, accessible from the host. Can be directly mapped to a folder in the host.

*** Running applications 				    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- \textbf{Link}: Docker mechanism to help containers communicate with each other. It's defined as \texttt{--link container:alias}:
  - \textit{container}: the name of the external, already running container,
  - \textit{alias}: the name used locally in the new container, pointing to the external container. Docker adds it to /etc/hosts, and defines some environment properties.
- \textbf{Exposed port}: Docker service can map host ports to internal ports, when the container starts.

*** Variables in Dockerfiles 					    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

- Based on wking's approach and code for Gentoo-based images:
 https://github.com/wking/dockerfile
- Modified for phusion-baseimage.
- Enhanced with in-house bash scripting framework: dry-wit.
- Allows placeholders in Dockerfiles.

\textit{``Built on the Docker cluster management toolkit Citadel, Shipyard gives you the ability to manage Docker resources including containers, hosts and more.}

    :END:

- Images can be deployed anywhere.
- It doesn't require a convention to map host volumes or data containers.

*** Cons 					      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

- Containers take much longer to start.

*** Cons 					      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5

- Containers need to be prepared to read their configuration from plain files.
- The command for launching containers depends on the Puppet configuration for that host.

- Puppet sets up the configuration for environment-aware images.
- No Puppet needed in production: just links to data containers.

*** Cons 					      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block

- SSL certificate magic takes place on intermediate Docker images.
